# ImageAnalysis - Thresholding
This is a batch processing script written in "ImageJ" that takes as inputs several 24-bit images of neuronal structures 
and converts them into binary images using thresholding. The script then calculates the length of the threadlike 
structures in the image. Also found in this repository is an exmaple of a representative raw image and the thresholded binary image.
